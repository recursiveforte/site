Working on a project, event, or organization with a mission to serve the public good or your community? Obtaining 501(c)(3) public charity status in the US just got easier.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of organizations from around the world apply for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS. From start to finish, the process for obtaining this status can take anywhere from 2-12 months, and as a nonprofit organizer, you have to be prepared for:

- $3,000 in up-front costs, from filing the applications for forms to support from legal council
  The potential for the IRS to reject your application (and you donâ€™t get your $ back ðŸ˜¢)
- An annual filing fee of $2,500
- Maintaining a good standing with the IRS by hiring bookkeepers and accountants for upkeep and tax preparation
- Closing down shop costs of up to $5,000 if you lose or terminate your status

Unfortunately for many, these costs and the time needed to organize can act as barriers that prevent their charitable initiatives from exiting an idea phase to hitting the ground running.

So why would you want to go through the hassle of applying for 501(c)(3) status?

Check out some benefits of becoming a legally recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the US:

- The ability to receive tax deductible donations from sponsors
- An incentive to U.S. donors to give to your organization (they can claim their gift on their personal taxes)
- Exemption from U.S. federal income tax and unemployment tax
- Potential exemption from state income, sales, and employment taxes
- Potential for reduced rates on postage, marketing, advertising, legal counsel, and more!

Fiscal sponsorship is a great way for anyone looking to avoid a headache with the traditional filing route to obtain the benefits of 501(c)(3) status.

Info pulling

Registered nonprofit organizations qualify for exemption from federal income and unemployment taxes in addition to possible exemption from state sales tax. With 501(c)(3) status, charitable organizations are able to receive grants and tax-deductible contributions that they otherwise would not be able to receive.

Registering with the IRS is a long, tedious, and potentially expensive process. Organizations must have $500 to $3,000 set aside to afford the start-up costs of filing legal paperwork and potentially hiring lawyers. The wait time for the IRS to review submitted paperwork is anywhere from 2-12 months. On top of that, the nonprofit must pay up to $2,500 annually to stay in good standing with the IRS; this doesnâ€™t include the costs of accounting and bookkeeping work. If an organization decides to terminate, the cost of filing the closing paperwork with the IRS amounts to around up to $5,000.

As an alternative to the traditional process, people may choose to become fiscally sponsored by an existing registered nonprofit. Fiscal sponsorship provides an accessible avenue for small charitable organizations and student-led organizations to obtain all the benefits of 501(c)(3) status without having to deal with the IRS. These organizations piggy-back on the fiscal sponsorâ€™s status and can pass certain overhead costs to the sponsor. In exchange, the sponsor typically requests a fee from revenue raised by these organizations.

supports passionate people with charitable by easing many of the start-up constraints and allows teams to direct their focus as much as possible towards their missions.

## What is the point of fiscal sponsorship?

Obtaining 501(c)(3) status from the IRS in the U.S. qualifies an organization as a public charity. The reason many individuals seek out this status is due to the following benefits:

Exemption from Federal income tax
Exemption from Federal unemployment tax.
Possible exemption from state income, sales, and employment taxes
Tax-exempt financing
Tax-deductible donations
Reduced postal rates
And much more...

To gain 501(c)(3) status, an organization has two options ahead of them:

File with the IRS to gain their own nonprofit status.
Become fiscally sponsored by an existing nonprofit.

Filing to become a nonprofit with the IRS means expecting the following:

Accruing around $3,000 in start-up costs for filing fees and lawyers
Waiting 2-12 months for the IRS to review submitted paperwork and either approve or deny the request
Spending $2500 annually to maintain nonprofit status
Maintaining good standing by hiring bookkeepers and accountants
Saving near $5,000 for closing costs in case the 501(c)(3) status is revoked

Seeking fiscal sponsorship offered by an existing nonprofit can guarantee:

Receiving access to legal 501(c)(3) status after agreeing to the nonprofitâ€™s terms and conditions
Having confidence that backend paperwork and taxes can be taken care of by the nonprofit
Agreeing on a fixed fee structure and not paying individual legal operating costs
Being able to terminate and file status separately at a given point in time

Fiscal sponsorship provides a great avenue for small start-up projects, student-led organizations, and anyone looking to avoid a headache with the IRS to obtain all the benefits of nonprofit status. It is also a great way for beginners to manage their finances and gauge whether becoming an independent nonprofit down the line is practical and financially feasible.
